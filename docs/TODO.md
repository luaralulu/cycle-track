# ‚úÖ Menstrual Cycle Tracker ‚Äì Implementation Checklist

## üìç Phase 1: Base Setup and Logging

### ‚úÖ Environment & Supabase Setup

- [x] Configure `.env` file with Supabase URL, keys, and user credentials
      **Acceptance Criteria**: `.env` is loaded; can authenticate and connect to Supabase programmatically.

- [x] Set up Supabase client and test auth with email/password
      **Acceptance Criteria**: Successfully logs in and logs success or error.

### ü©∏ Period Logging

- [x] Create a "Log Period" button
      **Acceptance Criteria**: Button is visible and clickable on screen.

- [x] When clicked, insert today's date with `cycle_day = 1`, `period = true`, and correct `user_id`
      **Acceptance Criteria**: Entry appears in Supabase with today's date and correct values.

- [ ] Recalculate predictions and update calendar view on log
      **Acceptance Criteria**: Next predicted period and PMS days update correctly after logging.

## üõ† Phase 2: Cron Job and Data Continuity

### ‚è±Ô∏è Daily Cron-Based Data Filler

- [x] Create script to run via GitHub Actions (or locally)
      **Acceptance Criteria**: Script runs daily and logs output.

- [x] Check if yesterday's entry is missing
      **Acceptance Criteria**: Script detects missing date.

- [x] If missing, insert:

  - `cycle_day = last + 1`
  - `period = true` if 2‚Äì5
  - `period = false` if 6+
    **Acceptance Criteria**: Entry is correctly added with valid values and `user_id`.

---

## üîÆ Phase 3: Prediction Engine

- [x] Fetch last 12 `cycle_day = 1` entries to calculate average cycle length
      **Acceptance Criteria**: Average cycle length is calculated accurately.

- [x] Predict next period based on average
      **Acceptance Criteria**: Predicted next period appears on the calendar.

- [x] Calculate PMS window (6‚Äì8 days before predicted period start)
      **Acceptance Criteria**: PMS days are correctly marked in data.
